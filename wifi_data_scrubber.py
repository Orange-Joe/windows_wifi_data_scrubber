''' 
Companion script to https://github.com/Orange-Joe/windows_wifi_password_gatherer.
Quickly remove WiFi SSIDs and passwords stored on a Windows 10 machine. 
This can also be done with 'netsh wlan delete profile name=* i=*'
This script has the added benefit of being able to exclude a profile from the deletion process.

# TODO: Add a feature to backup WiFi profiles as xml files using netsh wlan export function.
# TODO: Add a function to split --exclude argument by commas in order to support more than one excluded profile.
